# PPU-Students-Occupation

An android Game developed in *17/03/2016*

A simple game I created as my project for *Mobile Applications Development* Cource.  
The game is played by 2 teams, each of unlimited number of users.  
Each of the two teams must aim to occupy the land of PPU campus.  
A team member can occupy the land by running on top of it.  
The game duration is half an hour.  
The winner team is the one who occupies more lands in the campus, players can see their land on a map.
